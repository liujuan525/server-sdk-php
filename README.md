Rong Cloud Server SDK in PHP.

# Version Notes
To facilitate developer integration and better maintain the RongCloud Server SDK, RongCloud Server SDK 3.0 standardizes naming and calling conventions, with a clearer structure. Older versions of the Server SDK remain usable but will not receive new feature updates. If you are a new developer, it is recommended to use Server SDK 3.0. For developers already using older versions, direct upgrades are not supported, and it is strongly advised to retest before use.
